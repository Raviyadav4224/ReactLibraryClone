This project demonstrates how to create a basic React-like rendering engine and a simple useState hook from scratch. The implementation includes a custom render function to convert React elements into DOM elements and a basic state management system. Here's a step-by-step guide to understand the code and its components.

Cloning the React Library to perform -
1.React element creation
2.Re-rendering the react comonent on Change
3.Creating useState hook and cloning it's behavior

Approach -

1.React.createElement(type,props,...children) -
It returns a react element

2.ReactDOM.render method -

render(ReactElement || string || ArrayOfReactElements, rootElement)

It will append the DOM Element to the rootElement

1. We need to create the DOM Element
   created DOM Element can be a single element or an Array of elements
   If it is an Array of elements - Each element needs to be appended to the root element

2. createDomElement(reactElement) - It will create a DOM element using createElement with type as given reactElement.type and returns the created DOM Element

   Now reactElement type can be -
   1.string - create a textNode using that reactElement and return it
   2.function - create DOM element using reactElement.type(reactElement.props) value
   3.Array of React element - loop through all elements and create DOM element, again which can be a string,Array,function or simple react element
   4.reactElement (Default case)- return the element created using document.createElement(reactElement.type)

3. If props exists we need to set them as attributes in the created DOM element by setting props to domElement object as key value pairs
   domElement[attributeKey]=attributeValue

- Here children props doesnt gets over-riden
- style props accepts Object so in order to set that we need to set style prop of domElement
  domElement.style.[styleKey]=styleValue

4. While setting props, if Children exists we need to again createDomElement and append it to the its root element
    while doing thi child element can be a string,ArrayOfReactElement , none\
    when none then create a textNode and append it to its root


useState hook

The useState hook returns the current state value and setState function to update the state and re render it to the DOM and accepts initial value
